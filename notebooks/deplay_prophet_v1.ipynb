    "The alert_oos_flag output represents the weeks where the product \"Tablet PRO Blauw\" is flagged as likely being out-of-stock based on your sales data and the implemented OOS detection algorithm.

    "Using this divisor, the code computes a minimum length for a sequence of zeroes to be considered an out-of-stock event. Any zero sequence longer than this minimum length triggers the out-of-stock flag.\n",
